// Shared rank-and-rent voice handler — Telnyx TeXML
//
// (03) 9003 0108 is shared across all VIC rank-and-rent microsites. The greeting
// is brand-neutral and prompts the caller to mention their suburb and what they're
// calling about — that's how we identify which site sent the lead from the recording
// + transcript emails.
//
// Behaviour controlled by Netlify env vars:
//   - TENANT_FORWARD_NUMBER (E.164, e.g. "+61412345678") — if set, calls forward to the rented contractor with a "Pete's Lead" whisper
//   - TENANT_LABEL — what's whispered before connecting (default "Pete's Lead")
//
// When TENANT_FORWARD_NUMBER is unset, calls go straight to voicemail.
// When set, contractor hears the whisper, then the caller is patched through.
// If the contractor doesn't pick up within 22 seconds, the call falls through to voicemail.
//
// Telnyx TeXML app voice_url should point to this function:
//   https://toowoombaroofrepairs.netlify.app/.netlify/functions/voice
